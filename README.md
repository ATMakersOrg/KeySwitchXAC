# KeySwitchXAC
Control your XBox Adaptive Controller with your KeySwitch Hardware

This will be a partner project to the KeySwitch interface box, using the same hardware but different software.

Specifically, this software will need a custom version of the CircuitPython runtime that conforms to the restrictive joystick specification required by the current XAC firmware.
